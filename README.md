# Geomechanics Lab 1
An interactive web app to visualize Mohr’s Circle and basic failure envelope for stress analysis in geomechanics.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple lab tool for understanding the fundamentals of geomechanics, specifically stress states and failure criteria. It allows users to:

- Input principal stresses
- Visualize Mohr’s Circle
- Add a Coulomb failure envelope
- Observe stress conditions in relation to failure

## Geomechanics domain background

#### Principal Stresses
- Convention: **σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ σ₃**
- Represents normal stresses along principal directions

#### Mohr’s Circle
- A graphical representation of the state of stress at a point
- Shows the variation of shear and normal stress on different planes

#### Failure Envelope
- Based on Mohr-Coulomb criterion: **τ = c + σ·tan(φ)**
- Helps visualize whether a given stress state will cause failure

#### Effective Stress
- σ' = σ - Pp
- Important in geomechanics for understanding rock strength and failure in porous media

## Features
- Interactive input for σ₁, σ₂, σ₃ and pore pressure
- Real-time Mohr’s Circle visualization
- Adjustable cohesion c and friction angle φ for the failure envelope
- Failure condition highlighting (e.g., stress state exceeds envelope)
- Example stress states to load and visualize
